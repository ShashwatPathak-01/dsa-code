## 🚀 How It Works

1. You enter the **minutes and seconds** for the alarm.  
2. The program starts a **countdown timer** and displays the remaining time.  
3. When the time is up, the alarm sound starts playing continuously.  
4. To stop the alarm, you must **enter a randomly generated 6-character CAPTCHA correctly**.  
5. Once you solve the CAPTCHA, the alarm stops, and a greeting message is displayed.
